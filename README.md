# Readeck

Readeck is a self hosted web application that lets you save the
precious readable content of web pages you like and want to keep
forever.

## Easy to use 🪄

Like a page you're reading? Copy and paste the link in readeck,
and you're done!

Want to mark a bookmark as read, as a favorite or archive it?
Press the right button!

Want to add labels? Just enter a name in the form and press enter!

## Fast 🚀

Readeck is fast. It doesn't use any shiny single page application
framework that requires your browser to fetch a truckload of
javascript before doing anything. The server very fast response time
guaranties a smooth experience.

## Safe 🔒

Readeck creates archive of pages, including all the images, in a single zip
file that can even be used totally offline if you know where to get it.
In other words, when you save a page, don't worry about the images that might
disappear in a few years.

## Easy to operate ⚙️

Readeck does not need anything to run, no message broker, no external database,
no complex setup with fancy containers. No! Run the binary file and you're good
to go!

Although, when you need it, you can run readeck with postgresql, and it's very
likely that an optional redis server can be used soon.

## Boring 🥱

Readeck is built on top of boring technologies that just work. And it's wonderful!
