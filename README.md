Readeck is a simple web application that lets you save the
precious readable content of web pages you like and want to keep
forever. \
See it as a bookmark manager and a read later tool.

## Features

### üîñ Bookmarks

Like a page you're reading? Paste the link in Readeck and you're done!


### üì∏ Articles, pictures and videos

Readeck saves the readable content of web pages for you to read later. It also detects when a page is an image or a video and adapts its process accordingly.


### ‚≠ê Labels, favorites, archives

Move bookmarks to archives or favorites and add as many labels as you want.


### üñçÔ∏è Highlights

Highlight the important content of your bookmarks to easily find it later.


### üóÉÔ∏è Collections

If you need a dedicated section with all your bookmarks from the past 2 weeks labeled with "cat", Readeck lets you save this search query into a collection so you can access it later.


### üìñ Ebook export

What's best than reading your collected articles on your e-reader? You can export any article to an e-book file (EPUB). You can even export a collection to a single book!

On top of that, you can directly access Readeck's catalog and collections from your e-reader if it supports OPDS.


### üîé Full text search

Whether you need to find a vague piece of text from an article, or all the articles with a specific label or from a specific website, we've got you covered!


### üöÄ Fast!

Readeck is a modern take on so called boring, but proven, technology pieces. It guaranties very quick response times and a smooth user experience.


### üîí Built for your privacy and long term archival

Will this article you like be online next year? In 10 year? Maybe not; maybe it's all gone, text and images. For this reason, and for your privacy, text and images are all stored in your Readeck instance the moment you save a link.

With the exception of videos, not a single request is made from your browser to an external website.

## How to install

Done reading this promotional content? Good! Want to try Readeck on your laptop or a server? Even better!

### Binary file installation

- Go to the [releases](https://codeberg.org/readeck/readeck/releases) page and grab the binary release matching your system,
- Rename the file to `readeck` (or anything you fancy),
- Make the `readeck` file executable if not already the case,
- Move this file to the directory you just created,
- Go to the directory and launch the `readeck serve` command.


```bash
cd readeck
chmod a+x readeck
./readeck serve
```

The first time you launch Readeck, you'll have to create a user (you!) and then be on your way.

At the end of this short process, Readeck start and is accessible on:

**[http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)**

### Container

If you prefer to install or test Readeck with Docker or Podman, create a `readeck` folder somewhere and run the image:

```bash
mkdir readeck
cd readeck
docker run --rm -ti -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd):/readeck codeberg.org/readeck/readeck:latest
```

You'll find all the container images there: \

## Under the hood

Readeck was born out of frustration (and COVID lock-downs) from the tools that don't save everything related to the saved content, primarily images.
This key principle guided every step of Readeck development.

### The ZIP file

Every bookmark is stored in a single, immutable, ZIP file. Parts of this file (HTML content, images, etc.) are served directly by the application or converted to a web page or an e-book when needed.

### A simple database

Readeck has a very simple database schema with a few tables and uses a lot of JSON fields when appropriate. The recommended database engine is SQLite for an installation with a few users.

### A simple stack

Unlike many modern web applications, Readeck is not a single page application built on top of an API. There's not even a separate worker process.

Readeck is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and all its content is rendered server side with some interactivity brought by [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) and [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/).

This has proven to be a great combination when performance really matters.
