  <p>Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most
  striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and
  their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on
  their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails.</p>

  <p>Otters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for
  sheer enjoyment, such as making waterslides and then sliding on them into the
  water. They may also find and play with small stones. Different species vary
  in their social structure, with some being largely solitary, while others
  live in groups â€“ in a few species these groups may be fairly large.</p>
