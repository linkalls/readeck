# Labels

You can [add as many labels as you want to a bookmark](./bookmark.md#labels).\
There is no limit as to what can be a label. You can even add emojis if you like them.

## Label List

The [Label List](../../bookmarks/labels) shows all the labels in your bookmark collection, with a number indicating how many bookmarks carry a given label.

When you click on a label, you can list all the bookmarks carrying the label.

## Rename a label

On a given label page, you can click on the page's title (the label) to change its name.
