# User Profile

The [Profile section](readeck-instance://profile) of Readeck lets you change your personal information, you password and some other settings.

## Edit your profile

On the main profile page, you can change your username, your email address and choose the app's language.

## Change your password

On the [Password](readeck-instance://profile/password) page, you can change the password you use to connect to Readeck.

## API Tokens

An API Token lets you access and use the [Readeck API](readeck-instance://docs/api) for anything you'd like to build. You can create and manage tokens on the [API Tokens](readeck-instance://profile/tokens) section of your user profile.

You can limit what a given token can access through the API and for how long it's valid.

## Application Passwords

If you need to grant access to your Readeck account to a service or an app, you can't provide you main username and password; it won't work.

What you can do is create an [Application Password](readeck-instance://profile/credentials).

You can limit what a given password can access through the API.

Once you created an application password, you can use it to access the [Readeck API](readeck-instance://docs/api) or export services.

See the [Ebook Catalog](./opds.md) help page for a real life example.

**Note**: although you can use an application password to access the API, it is recommended to use an API Token when possible.
