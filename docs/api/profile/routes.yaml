auth:
  summary: Authenticate
  description: |
    This route performs the authentication with a username and a password and returns a token
    that you can use for all API requests.

    You don't need to perform a request to this route each time you're using the API, only do it
    once and keep the token somehow. You can use this route to provide a first time authentication
    in a mobile application or any API client you may build and only store the resulting token.

    You MUST provide an application name.

    Alternatively, you can [create an authentication token](../profile/tokens) directly from
    Readeck.
